Hello! I'm hitesh. I'm a 21 y/o student pursuing my undergrad degree in computer science from pillai college of engineering, new panvel.

I'm a self-taught programmer. I started programming during my 12th standard summer break. I started with web development and since then I like working on the web a lot (mostly frontend). If you want to know about what programming languages I know, they are - javascript, python, and a little bit of c. I'm currently learning typescript✌️.

My tech stack ranges from html, css, javascript, react.js, next.js, chakra-ui & tailwind css for the frontend, and express.js, adonis.js, typeORM, and postgreSQL for the backend. I have used cypress.io for automated e2e testing and storybook for UI testing.

I recently got an experience in t3-stack (typescript, trpc, tailwind) along with next.js, prisma and next-auth👨🏻‍💻.

Things I do other than dev and programming?🤔 I do watch tons of movies and shows. SUITS is my favorite. I do like wildlife photography, but haven't done it for the past 2 years. Here's my [photography page](https://www.instagram.com/h85._._/). I also like listening to music.

Apart from these, I'm also an active member of [CSI-PCE's](https://www.instagram.com/_csipce/) Technical Team.
